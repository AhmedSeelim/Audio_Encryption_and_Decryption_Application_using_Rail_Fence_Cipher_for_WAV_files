Project Overview: The "Audio Encryption and Decryption Application using Rail Fence Cipher for WAV files" is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that enables users to perform encryption and decryption operations on audio files using the Rail Fence Cipher encryption technique. The application utilizes the tkinter library for GUI design and incorporates the voice module, which provides functionalities for recording, playing, and manipulating audio data. The primary goal of the project is to provide a user-friendly tool for securing audio data through encryption and securely decrypting it when needed.
Key Features:
1.	Audio Recording and Encryption: Users can record audio from the microphone and encrypt it using the Rail Fence Cipher technique. The encrypted audio is then saved as a WAV file for further use.
2.	Audio Encryption from PC: The application allows users to upload an existing audio file from their computer and encrypt it using the Rail Fence Cipher encryption method.
3.	Audio Decryption from PC: Users can upload a previously encrypted audio file and securely decrypt it using the specified decryption key.
4.	Real-time Audio Playback: The application supports real-time audio playback for recorded and decrypted audio files, providing users with instant feedback on the encryption and decryption processes.
Technology Stack:
•	Programming Language: Python
•	GUI Library: Tkinter
•	Audio Processing: PyAudio, Numpy, Wave
Getting Started:
1.	Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
2.	Install Required Libraries: Install the required libraries, such as tkinter, pyaudio, numpy, and wave, to run the application.
3.	Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from the version control system.
4.	Launch the Application: Run the main Python script to launch the GUI application.
5.	Use the Application: Follow the GUI instructions to record, encrypt, decrypt, and play audio files.
